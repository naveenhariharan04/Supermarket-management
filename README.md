# Supermarket-Management-System

## Task
The competition task was to build a management system for a convenience store in Carleton within 7 hours (We continued and added a few things and cleaned some code up), where the managers would be able to manage stock, volunteers, and the main schedule. 

## What We Got Done
We finished the management of the stock and volunteers, and data visualization of the popularity of the stock. 

## Stack Used
We used the MEAN stack to build this which allowed us to get a quick start. We followed an MVC architecture to allow us to concurrently develop the application.
